# Layers – OSI Testing Suite

Layers is a standalone application that automates comprehensive testing across all seven layers of the OSI model.  
It is designed for network engineers, security architects, and system administrators who need deep visibility into network behavior, performance bottlenecks, and security gaps.

---

## Features

- **Automated OSI Layer Testing**  
  Sequentially or selectively test each layer of the OSI stack (Physical → Application).  

- **Layer Coverage**
  - **Layer 1 – Physical**: Connectivity verification, cable/link validation, signal strength checks.  
  - **Layer 2 – Data Link**: MAC discovery, VLAN verification, spanning tree status.  
  - **Layer 3 – Network**: IP reachability, subnet boundary checks, routing table validation.  
  - **Layer 4 – Transport**: TCP/UDP port scans, socket testing, handshake validation.  
  - **Layer 5 – Session**: Session establishment and teardown analysis.  
  - **Layer 6 – Presentation**: Encoding/decoding verification, TLS/SSL handshake integrity.  
  - **Layer 7 – Application**: HTTP/S, DNS, FTP, SMTP, API endpoint validation.  

- **Reporting Engine**  
  - Generate human-readable **PDF, CSV, or JSON** reports.  
  - Export detailed logs for audits and compliance.  

- **GUI & CLI**  
  - Modern GUI with real-time dashboards.  
  - CLI for automation and integration into pipelines.  

- **Automation Friendly**  
  Integrates with CI/CD workflows, monitoring systems, and security scanners.

## Use Cases

- Troubleshooting connectivity across multiple OSI layers.  
- Pre-deployment validation of network designs.  
- Continuous verification for security posture and compliance.  
- Education and training for network fundamentals.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ (for CLI edition)  
- Node.js 20+ (for GUI edition)  
- Recommended: Docker (for containerized deployment)

### Quick Start

**Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/layers.git
cd layers
````

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# OR for GUI
npm install
```

**Run CLI mode:**

```bash
python main.py --test all
```

**Run GUI mode:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## Example Usage

Test full OSI stack:

```bash
python main.py --test all
```

Test specific layer (e.g., Layer 3 – Network):

```bash
python main.py --test network
```

Export results to PDF:

```bash
python main.py --test all --export pdf
```

## Roadmap

* [ ] Integration with NetBox for asset context
* [ ] Enhanced Layer 6 TLS/SSL analysis with cipher grading
* [ ] Real-time topology visualization
* [ ] REST API for external integrations
